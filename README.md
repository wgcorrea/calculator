## About

This project will show some basics of TDD and other techniques while I help teams to onboard some best practices. Some of my choices and architectural decisions were intentionally optimized to help with the learning curve and do not necessarily apply to production-grade solutions.

## Pre-requisites

- Node v18.x
- NPM v9.x
- [NX](https://nx.dev)

## Setup

Execute in the terminal:

```
npm install
```

## Running Tests

Execute in the terminal

```
nx test mathextra
```

or if you want to run in dev mode, watching for changes:

```
nx test mathextra --watch
```
